# Algs4 C++ library

`Algs4_cpp` goal is to be a C++ library port of the java code in <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/">algs4.jar</a>.

## Render and StdDraw 
If what you ever wanted to try [Algorithms, 4th Edition](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)'s exercises in C++ with drawing features, **StdDraw** is implemented with its own render in this library!    
The render was building using GDI+ and PIMPL idiom making it easy to replace it with your render if you like.  

## Build
You can build the solution using Visual Studio 19 by opening `Algs4_cpp.sln` and building the project.  
You can also use build it using any other compiler too but be aware that GDP+ is designed to run on a windows environment.  

## Contribution

Issue reports and code fixes are welcome. I appreciate the contribution of high-quality test cases, bug-fixes, and coding style improvements as well.
